Make a Music Player with tkinter! - #tkinter30 0/30
This is a very detailed, in-depth project developed using Python tkinter.
In this GUI application, we can add music files to the playlist,
we will be able to Play these files,
we will be able to Mute these files,
we can also control the volume of the music,
we will also be able to Pause, Rewind and Delete items from the playlist. 
We will also have a status bar which shows the current status of the playlist and view which song is being played. 
We are going to make a Cool project using tkinter by applying themes, styles. 
We will be using Pygame library mixer along with tkinter to make this application.
